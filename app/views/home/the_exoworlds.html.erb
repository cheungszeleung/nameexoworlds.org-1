    <h1 class='center-text'>The ExoWorlds</h1>
    <p>The ExoWorlds list of exoplanets and their host stars being available for public naming at the initiative of the IAU is a list compiled from several exoplanet databases, including exoplanet.eu [2] and exoplanets.org [3].</p>
    <p>This list includes well-studied exoplanets discovered over twenty years, up to 31 December 2008. A period of at least five years since the discovery has been considered as a simple and satisfactory criterion to include exoplanets which can be considered as confirmed. All the discoveries were made using various methods, including radial velocities, transits, microlensing and direct imagery.</p>
    <p>For these exoplanets, the scientific nomenclature follows the nomenclature rules widely adopted by the scientific community, which are drawn from the rules for naming binary stars. For each planet, the name of the host star (around which planets are orbiting) is followed by a lower-case letter: b for the first discovered exoplanet, c for the second, etc. (The letters are capitalized in the case of binaries: the "primary" star name is followed by "A", and its companion stars are labelled by the same name followed by "B", "C", etc.).</p>
    <p>In the ExoWorlds list, five stars already have common names: Fomalhaut (alpha Piscis Austrini) is one of the four “royal stars” of ancient Persia, with Aldebaran, Antares, and Regulus; Pollux (beta Geminorum) is the twin brother of Castor, son of Zeus (Jupiter) and Leda, from the ancient Greek and Roman mythologies — the constellation Gemini is named after them (Gemini means twins in latin). Three other stars also have common names: gamma Cephei (Errai, Arabic for shepherd), epsilon Tauri (Ain, Arabic for the bull's Eye) and iota Draconis (Edasich, Arabic also). These stars have common names as well in other cultures [1].</p>
    <p>Consequently these five stars cannot be considered for public naming.</p>

    <h1 class="center-text">About the 20 Systems</h1>
    <p>While there are no astronomical names for exoplanets, the host stars have well known and multiple astronomical designations. The IAU standardized the names, abbreviations, and boundaries for the 88 constellations, and the
nomenclature of astronomical objects such as stars, nebulae, or galaxies is described in <a href="http://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/">http://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/</a>.</p>
<p>Standard astronomical nomenclature allows one to find and identify stars or astronomical objects and assists astronomers in conducting research on specific objects.  The SIMBAD astronomical database provides basic data, cross-identifications, bibliography and measurements for astronomical objects outside the solar system (<a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/">http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/</a>).  Ian Ridpatth’s excellent book Star Tales describes the myths, legends, and history of constellations and is online at <a href="http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/contents.htm">http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/contents.htm</a>.</p>

<p>There are four standard ways to designate stars and astronomical objects:</p>

<p>1. Ancient proper names usually Greek or Arabic in origin but different cultures had different names for the same star.  Many but not all of the stellar names relate to the constellations in which the star is located.  A classic book about the history of star names in multiple cultures is R.H. Allen's "Star-Names and their Meanings" (G.E. Stechert, New York, 1899; <a href="https://archive.org/details/starnamesandthe00allegoog">https://archive.org/details/starnamesandthe00allegoog</a>) – other sites lists Gibson’s  compilation of star nams at  <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~gibson/starnames/starnames.html">http://www.naic.edu/~gibson/starnames/starnames.html</a></p>
<p>2. Constellation based names are used for the brightest stars.  The Bayer star chart and catalog (1603) ordered stars in each constellation (using the Latin genitive or possessive constellation name) by approximate brightness using Greek or Roman letters with Alpha to label the brightest star, Beta the second brightest star, etc.   For example, the brightest star in Cygnus (the Swan) is Alpha Cygni, which is also called Deneb.   Flamsteed created a catalog of 3000 stars (1725) ordered from west to east by celestial longitude (right ascension).  The Flamsteed numbers, for example 61 Cygni, were introduced by Lalande in the 1783 French edition of Flamsteeds’catalogue and listed consecutively in each constellation.</p>
<p>3. Catalogs are named for the astronomer(s) who created the catalog; the type of object (hot stars, close stars, bright stars, etc.); and the observatory, telescope or instrument used identify and study the objects.  The astronomical objects are listed by a sequential number that is usually ordered from west to east by celestial longitude (right ascension).</p>
<p>4. Coordinate-based catalogs list an acronyms or abbreviations of an astronomical objects or survey followed by their celestial longitude  (right ascension) and celestial latitude (declination) as their unique name or designation and ordered from west to east by right ascension. For example there are catalogs for pulsars (PSR), quasars (QSO), and or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).</p>
